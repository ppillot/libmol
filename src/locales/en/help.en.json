This group is subsequently very diverse.  \n\nLabels in the status bar beneath the visualization frame, specify every biochemical nature present in the model and its corresponding color.","colorByresidue":"# Colour by residue\nA residue regroups atoms that make a subunit of a chain (or polymer) in a molecular model. Each residue (or group of residues chemically akin to each other) has a specific color.\n\nThere are several types of residues depending on the biochemical nature of the chain.  \nMain groups are:\n* [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid), that make proteins,\n* [nucleotides](lexicon-nucleotide), that make [nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic) (DNA or RNA).\n\nOther kinds of residues, such as [ligands](lexicon-ligand) (saccharides, prosthetic groups, ions, etc...) and solvents (water) may also be part of molecular models.\n\nLabels in the status bar beneath the visualization frame, specify every residue present in the model by its ID and its corresponding color.  \n**Tip**: Hovering over a residue's ID triggers a tooltip with its extended name (if this information is available from the model file).","colorBysstruc":"# Colour by secondary structure\n\nThis color scheme reveals specific motifs of amino acids disposition favored in proteic chains, known as **secondary structures**. This option is only available when proteins are selected and displayed with a simplified representation ([backbone](display-backbone) or [cartoon](display-cartoon)).\n\nSecondary structures recognized are:\n* [beta strands](lexicon-strand),  \nBeta strands (β strands) are linear successions of amino acids generally combined to make planar or cylindrical associations in the protein structure.\n* [turns](lexicon-turn),  \nTurns are brutal change of direction in the orientation of an amino acids chain.\n* [alpha helices](lexicon-helix),  \nAlpha helix (α helix) appears when the amino acid chain coils along an axis. Alpha helix contains an average of 3.6 amino acids per helical turn.\n* [3-10 helices](lexicon-helix).  \n3-10 helix is a shorter motif compared to alpha helix, having only 3 amino-acids per helical turn.\n\nThese motifs are stabilized through hydrogen bonding between amino acids.\n\nLabels in the status bar beneath the visualization frame list each secondary structure with its corresponding color.  \nSecondary structures assignment to specific portions of the amino acid chain is provided by the molecular file. If this information is not available, a computation is performed using fast Zhang & Skolnick TM-align method, which may lead to discrepant results.","colorPalette":"# Color palette\nThis is a user defined color. The color picked is assigned to every atom in the current selection set.  \nIts main use is to highlight a specific portion of the molecular model.\n\nTo use it:\n* first, select the part you want to highlight\n* then color it by picking a relevant color from the palette \n\nThe chosen color is also displayed as a label in the status bar.","contactsHbond":"# Hydrogen bonds\nElectronegative atoms (such as nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) covalently bound to a hydrogen atom tend to attract electrons towards them, at the expense of the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atom then gets a positive partial charge, while the \"donor\" atom gains a negative partial charge. The hydrogen atom may therefore be attracted to another electronegative atom (named \"acceptor\" atom) and form a hydrogen bond.\n\nThe hydrogen bond energy is low (&#8776 30kJ/mol, compared to 400kJ/mol for a covalent bond) and it engages atoms separated by short distances (0.2nm in water for example).\n\nThe Libmol software (based on the NGL library) distinguishes 4 categories of hydrogen bonds:\n* **Backbone H bond**: these are the bonds between the nitrogen and the oxygen from the backbone of the neighboring amino acids in a polypeptidic chain. These are responsible for secondary structures ([helices](lexicon-helice) and [strands](lexicon-feuillet))\n* **Water H bonds**: these hydrogen bonds are sometimes involved in the active sites of certain enzymes (such as hydrolases)\n* **Weak H bonds**: these hydrogen bonds involve weakly electronegative atoms (such as carbon)\n* **Other H bonds**: these bonds explain most of the interactions between different molecules or between the different structures of a protein.\n","contactsHydrophobic":"# Hydrophobic interactions\nIn an hydrated environment, water molecules are organized in clusters behaving as cages around hydrophobic side chains. When two such hydrophobic side chains come close to each other, the water clusters merge resulting in a more stable association.\n\nA survey of the molecular complexes between protein and ligands in the Protein Databank has revealed that hydrophobic interactions are the main type of non covalent interactions binding ligands to proteins.\n\nHydrophobic interactions are instrumental to certain functions. For example, they occur in the binding of ligands to hydrophobic pockets (heme in hemoglobin, steroid receptor ligand binding domain), they anchor membrane proteins to the lipid bilayer, they are part of the gating mechanism in ion channels. \n ","contactsMetal":"# Metal interactions\nThese interactions occur mostly between a metallic cation and metal binding partners named ligands. Bonds are defined as **dative** when they are made of an electron duet \"taken\" from the ligand (called the donor, the metal being the bond acceptor). Bonds types can also be **ionic** when the metal is a cation, interacting with anions.\n\nThe geometry of these interactions depends on the metal coordination number. For example in biological molecules, iron coordination number is 6 which makes it the center of an octahedron.\n","contactsPi":"# π-π and cation-π Interactions\nAromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine) or nucleobases from nucleic acids may interact with neighboring aromatic ring bearing compounds (π-stacking) or with cations (cation-π interactions).  \n\nAromatic rings stacking between nucleotides from the same chain is one of the main interactions in nucleic acid structures. Binding of several small ligands with their respective receptor (for example between acetylcholine and the nicotinic receptors) relies on interactions between cations from the ligands and aromatic amino acids from the receptor.\n\nThese interactions originate from the spatial distribution of electronic densities around aromatic rings (due to π orbitals). For example, aromatic rings centers have a lower electronic density and can interact with higher electronic density harboring rings borders.\n","contactsSaltbridge":"# Salt bridge\nIn an aqueous phase, depending on the pH, some amino acids may bear a positive or a negative charge. For example, amino acids with an acidic side chain such as glutamate or aspartate have a negative charge at pH7. [Nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic) also bear negative charges on their phosphate group at this pH.\n\nTwo molecules having opposite charges exert a mutual attraction. If they are close enough, they can make an ionic bond also called salt bridge.\n\n","contacts":"# Non covalent interactions\nThis tab is where you can control and get informations about non covalent interactions:\n* [Hydrogen bonds](contacts-hbond)\n* [Salt bridges](contacts-saltbridge)\n* [Metal coordination](contacts-metal)\n* [Hydrophobic interactions](contacts-hydrophobic)\n* [π-stacking and cation-π interactions](contacts-pi)\n\n## Definitions\nA **covalent interaction** bonds two atoms from the same molecule by sharing an **electron** duet. Non covalent interactions may occur between atoms of the same chain, between different chains from the same molecule or between two different molecules (such as a protein and a ligand). The corresponding binding energy of a single non covalent interaction is generally weaker than the one of a covalent bond. These interactions are critical to many biological processes such as contact between molecules, spatial conformation, biochemical reactions.\n\n## Guide\nTo display interactions with a specific residue or a specific chain, you can right-click on this object from the 3D model or the **Sequence tab**.

Amino acids have two functionnal groups (amine and carboxyl) that interacts between each other to form peptidic bonds.  \nEach amino acid has a specific sidechain confering its chemical properties. ","lexiconCoude":"# Turns\nTurns are among the main patterns taken by [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid) chains in a [protein](lexicon-protein) (also known as secondary structures). A turn is a distinguishable fold, hairpin like, in a polypeptidic chain.","lexiconCpk":"# CPK coloring\nThe CPK coloring code (Corey, Pauling and Koltun) is the conventional coloring of atoms used in chemistry. It identifies atomic elements in molecular models.\nThis code was defined by the chemists R. Corey and L. Pauling and then improved by W. Koltun. Currently molecular visualization tools use variations of this initial code.\n\nThe code of the main atoms in organic molecules is:\n\nSymbol | Coloring code | Element\n------------ | ------------- | -------------\n**C** | ![Carbon](static/img/c.png)| **Carbon**\n**H** | ![Hydrogen](static/img/h.png) | **Hydrogen**\n**O** | ![Oxygen](static/img/o.png) | **Oxygen** \n**N** | ![Nitrogen](static/img/n.png) | **Nitrogen**\n**S** | ![Sulfur](static/img/s.png) | **Sulfur** \n**P** | ![Phosphorus](static/img/p.png) | **Phosphorus** \n","lexiconHelix":"# Helices\nHelices are among the main patterns taken by [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid) chains in a [protein](lexicon-protein) (also known as secondary structures).  \nIn a helix, the amino acid chain is wound around an axis. The side chains of the amino acids point towards the outside of the helix axis. The amino acids in a helix establish hydrogen bonds, with the neighbouring amino acids of the next helical turn and of the previous one.\nDepending on the **pitch** of the helix (number of amino acids per helical turn), different categories of helices are defined (helix α, helix 3-10, helix π having respectively 3.6, 3 and 5 amino acids per helical turn).\n","lexiconHetero":"# Hetero atoms\nThis class of chemical compounds is diverse. It includes all the molecules not belonging to the groups of [proteins](lexicon-protein), [nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic), water molecules nor carbohydrates.  \nIt contains [ligands](lexicon-ligand) in association with proteins such as heme groups in globins, certain vitamins acting as cofactors, ions involved in catalysis, etc...  \nThese also include lipids surrounding some membrane proteins or other substances used as solvents during the experimental determination.","lexiconLigand":"# Ligands\n**Ligands** are small molecules linked to the studied macromolecules (proteins and nucleic acids). The ligands may be involved in the molecule function.\nThe chemical nature of the ligands can be either organic or mineral.\nOrganic ligands may be carbohydrates, lipids, hemes or any other organic molecules.\nInorganic ligands may be ions, metal atoms or other inorganic molecules.\nThe ligands attach to the macromolecules by covalent or non-covalent bonds (ionic, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals interactions). \n","lexiconNucleic":"# Nucleic acids (DNA - RNA)\nNucleic acids are large-scale organic molecules whose main role is to store and transmit genetic information.  \nThey are made of a succession of building units: the [nucleotides](lexicon-nucleotide).  \nNucleic acids derive their name from the facts that they were identified first in the nucleus and that the nucleotides contain a **nucleobase** and a **phosphoric acid** part.  \nDNA and RNA difference is based on the type of carbohydrate present in each nucleotide, respectively **deoxyribose** for DNA and **ribose** for RNA.  \nNucleotides bond with their neighbors on the same chain by a covalent bond between the phosphate group and the (deoxy) ribose group.  \nTypically DNA contains two nucleotidic chains, maintained by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. RNA is often made of a single chain, which can be folded back on itself, thus forming secondary structures maintained by bonds between bases (loops, pins, etc.).  \nIn Libmol, one can distinguish between the two types of nucleic acids using [color by biochemical nature](color-bynature) coloring pattern. They can be selected distinctively with the DNA or RNA  keyword in the [selection command line](select-command-line).  \n","lexiconNucleotide":"# Nucleotides\nNucleotides are the building blocks of [nucleic acids](lexicon-nucleic) such as __DNA__ or __RNA__. \nA nucleotide is made of three parts:\n* the __Nucleobase__, or __nitrogenous base__. They exist in 5 different main types (__Adenine__, __Guanine__, __Thymine__, __Cytosine__, __Uracile__) which can undergo chemical modifications (particularly in RNAs)\n* the __Carbohydrate__ which can either be a __ribose__ (in RNA), or a __deoxyribose__ (in DNA)\n* the __Phosphate__ group\n","lexiconOther":"# Other atoms","lexiconProtein":"# Proteins\nProteins are large-scale and complex organic molecules made of at least one chain of [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid).\nAmino acid composition (governed by cell's genetic information) is the main responsible for protein properties such as its shape and function.  \nProteins undertake different roles inside and outside of cells:\n* Communication (peptidic messengers, receptors)\n* Structure (as components of the cytoskeleton, the extracellular matrix, the chromatin and chromosomes ...)\n* Chemical reactions (enzymes)\n* Defense and attack (peptidic toxins, antibodies, receptors of the immune system)\n* Etc...","lexiconStrand":"# Beta strands\nβ-strands are among the main patterns taken by [amino acids](lexicon-aminoacid) chains in a [protein](lexicon-protein) (also known as secondary structures).  \nβ-strands have a planar conformation. Amino acids side chains generally point perpendicularly to the strand's plane. Amino acids bind to neighbouring strands through hydrogen bonding. Adjoining β-strands may form larger scale structures such as barrels.\n","lexiconTechnique":"# Techniques for determining the structure of molecules.\n\nMolecules are inaccessible to direct observation by conventional techniques. Indirect techniques are used to devise models of these molecules.\n\n## X-ray Crystallography\nThe molecule studied is purified and then placed under crystallization conditions so as to form an ordered stack. When an X-ray beam is aimed at this crystal, the electro-magnetic waves are diffracted and make interference figures on a detector (a set of spots). The locations of these spots depend on the electronic cloud of the molecule, which can be reconstituted by mathematical methods.  \nThe amino acids making the protein can then be fitted into this electronic cloud so as to build a complete model.  \nThis method is the most commonly used for molecular models determination. The resolution is usually too sparse for determining the positions of the hydrogen atoms.  which do not appear in the models. It may be noted that this is only a model and that during the determination, the molecules studied are conditions far removed from the biological conditions. On the other hand, some proteins do not crystallize and can not be determined by this technique.\n\n## Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)\nA solution of the sample to be analyzed is placed in a strong magnetic field. The atoms are subjected to radio waves. The analysis of the observed resonances is used to determine the neighboring atoms as well as the conformation of the bonded atoms. From these informations a set of restraints is obtained and used to find the different possible models in accordance. Thus, the NMR technique leads to a set of several possible models. It is suitable for small to medium molecules and has the advantage of being applied to molecules in solution, which is closer than crystals to in vivo conditions.\n\n## 3D electron microscopy (3DEM)\nThis technique is currently in full expansion. The term covers a wide range of experimental procedures. For example, it may consist of imaging large-scale complexes at different viewing angles. Computerized image analysis methods are  applied to create a 3D structure from these datasets. Electron diffraction can be performed if the structure is sufficiently periodic or can be crystallized. When the resolution is low, this technique is combined with crystallography to fit the atomic structures coming from crystallography into the envelope obtained by 3DEM.  \n","selectAll":"# Select all atoms\nThis control selects the **whole set of atoms** present in the molecular model independently of the chemical nature of the compounds they are a part of, nor of the chain to which they belong.\n![Selection](static/img/select.png)\nThe pre-visualization of the selection is transiently displayed when the mouse hovers and makes it possible to check the quality of the selection made.","selectCommandLine":"# Select by Selection Command\nThis text box allows you to enter a selection command to make more complex selections or faster than through the sequence mode.\nAtoms whose characteristics match the keywords are selected.\n\nOnce the command is correct, enable the selection by pressing the Enter key or clicking on the validation button.\n\nThe pre-visualization of the selection is transiently displayed on mouseover and allows to check the quality of the selection made.
